This is my first app from scratch. 

My goal is to create a web app to be used by bars to track and report inventory. This includes monthly inventory, tracking liquor costs versus revenue, building beer, wine, and cocktail menus and costing them appropriately. 


In addition, I'd like to be able to build cocktials in the app and immediately see their pour cost, variable pricing based different pour costs.
